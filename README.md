# Codefundo 2018
  
 We are planning to build a system which can categorize or classify a textual data using python Deep Neural Network with the help of google TensorFlow.  

## how does it works

Our project is based on text classication of textual data which simply means to classify feeded text into some class or category which is possible using Tensorflow which is a deep learning library. Our aim is to assign a category to an input text. This can be achieved by training a neural network on data indicating what text represents(category). We will be using Natural Language Processing for our classification project. As we know text cannot be processed by tensorflow, so we need to convert the data into bag of words model and then feed it in our tensorflow model. The data processing step involves- stemming and tokenizing and finally a bag of words model is created. The bag of words model is used to create a unique list of words.

There is no need of data preparation as we are using a dataset of 2014_India_floods which contains tweets from twitter as text and its assigned category. In this dataset we are having 9 different categories regarding natural disaster.
Once the csv is loaded, we need to clean the data and then form bag of words and convert the data to tensorflow specification. Then we need to start our model and feed the training dataset into it. After training our model, now we can test the neural network  text classification model on newer sentences to predict their
category.

## How users can get started with the project

Users like NGO's, organisations etc can get categorical tweets from our project which can help them to get different informations like information regarding infrastructure damage, no. of deaths etc. So, this project can help them to figure out current situation and take decision accordingly.

## Dataset we are using

We are using dataset of the 2014 Pakistan Floods.
